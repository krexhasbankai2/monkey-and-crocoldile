Once Upon A time in a forest, there lived a monkey who recided on a berry tree.
And in the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife.
One day the crocodile came to the bank and the kind-heated monkey gave
him some berries, and after that they became good friends.
The crocodile's wife was very greedy and so she wanted the friendship to end and kill the monkey.
